# CD lab (2020-2023)

2020-2023 \| Computational design \| Gh

I started learning Grasshopper in 2020, when the world was on pause due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I was particularly interested in the intersection of computational design and designing the natural world. Unlike typical modeling methods, computational modeling does not model objects, but rather designs the process of how objects are made. I think this is similar to how natural objects are made based on the laws of physics, genes, etc.
