# WINDOW

2015-2016 \| Industrial design \| Concept \| w/ Tomoki Asakusa

## Incorporate eco-cycle into urban living

Household waste is often overlooked, ending up in landfills or incineration and contributing to emissions. WINDOW introduces a small urban eco-cycle, converting raw garbage into fertilizer and supporting home gardening,  fostering sustainability and a stronger connection to daily ecological practices. 

The project balanced mechanical design, a pedal-stir composter and self-watering planters, with user experience and interaction, creating a minimal, approachable product that makes waste management intuitive, and engaging. 

The project won the Konica Minolta Social Design
Award 2016.

### Experience

After throwing garbage into the lower composter, step on a pedal once a day to stir compost. Aerobic microbes turn raw garbage into natural fertilizer while heating up to 50°C and eliminating odor. Fertilizer can be used to grow plants on the bottom watering planters which supply water for several days.

### Product design

The product design aimed at a consistent design language that combines a minimal profile and friendly details.  These appear on clean details of the handle of the entry opening and ventilation, and the warm surfaces of the planter handle and pedal.

### Design process

The clean profile was inspired from “window” which allow light and wind to pass through and does not block view. A cylindrical bottom comes from the stirring structure of composter. A unique opening mechanism was designed to enhance an experience of throwing garbage into the composter.
