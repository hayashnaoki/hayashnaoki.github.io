# BYB

2018 \| Industrial design \| Concept \| w/ Yuki Itoh

## Break your biases: Linking past and future disasters

BYB combines a mobile app and road-embedded guide lights to help residents experience past disasters and improve evacuation routes. By simulating hazards and providing intuitive light and voice guidance, the system
counters “normalcy bias,” supporting faster, safer evacuation while raising ongoing regional disaster awareness. 

The design focused on ideation based on research into disaster drills and normalcy bias, validating guidance through prototyping, with the goal of providing effective and clear guidance that concretely connects the digital disaster map to real-world evacuation routes.

The project won the [Asia Design Prize 2019](http://asiadesignprize.com/index.php?mid=exhibition&page=6&document_srl=49203).
