# SPOWC

## Steam-powered cleaning for a better cooking experience

SPOWC is a compact, cordless steam cleaner for professional cooks, making daily kitchen cleanup easy and enjoyable. Its lightweight, dock-charged design and exposed internal components combine performance with a distinctive, professional look. I integrated internal components, ergonomics, and usability from the start, using sketches, cardboard prototypes, CAD modeling, and a full-scale mock-up to refine scale, grip angle, and styling, resulting in a functional and visually expressive product.

### Design process

Through reverse engineering of the used steam cleaner, SPOWC's components layout was considered. I assumed 1/2 of normal boiler capacity as a steam cleaner for daily use. Quick sketches and dirty prototypes were used in parallel to study the scale, usability, styling ideas and proportions of SPOWC. As a result, the 10° grip and the idea of 'minimal cover to reveal internal components' were chosen.

In parallel with cardboard prototyping, CAD modeling was used to study
SPOWC's detailed proportion. After that, a 1/1 scale mock-up was made to
test how it looks in kitchen space.
