# PLOT BOT

2025-ongoing \| Digital fabrication \| Prototype

## Mecanum wheeled pen plotter with infinite plotting area

The project started as a final project of [Fab Academy](https://fabacademy.org/) 2025 at FabLab Kannai. This is a mobile pen plotter with mecanum wheels, capable of drawing over an area much larger than its body. It uses a Raspberry Pi Pico to parse G-code via serial communication, controlling four wheels, stepper motors, and a Z-axis servo, with end stops for homing. I have learned everything from project management and mechanical and electronics design to PCB fabrication, and assembly.
